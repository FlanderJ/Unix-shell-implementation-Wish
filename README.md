# Unix-shell-implementation-Wish
The idea of this program is to work as a relatively simple Unix shell (CLI) prompt (like Bash for example). 
The shell creates a child process that executes the commands the user gives as input, and after executing a task, the shell will ask next input.  

You may invoke the program in the following way:
1. prompt> ./wish
- This will start the program and you may now give Unix commands as input!

2. prompt> ./wish batch.txt
- This is the so-called "batch mode", and the program will execute all commands that are listed in the input file ("batch.txt" in this example).
- Note that this will not start "wish prompt" it just reads and executes all of the commands in the input file!

NOTE: The shell itself does not implement any commands. All it does is finds the executable commands in one of the directories specified by the path and create a process to run them. 
The initial shell path contains one directory: Â´/bin'.


The program contains three different built-in commands:
1. exit: When the user types "exit", the shell calls the exit system call with parameter 0.
2. cd: This command changes the directory, it takes one argument.
3. path: The path command takes 0 or more arguments, with each argument separated by whitespace from the others.
         A typical usage would be like this: wish> path /bin /usr/bin, which would add /bin and /usr/bin to the search path of the shell.
         If the user sets the path to empty, then the shell should not be able to run any programs (except built-in commands).
         The path command always overwrites the old path with the newly specified path.


Few additional notes:
- Redirection is implemented. If the user wants to send output in a file instead of the console, the user can type "command > output.txt", for example, ls -la > output.txt.
  There is an additional feature related to redirection: the standard error output of the file is rerouted to the file output.
  In addition, do note that redirection is not tested using built-in commands!
- Parallel commands are implemented. This can be used with an ampersand operator as follows: wish> cmd1 & cmd2 args1 args2 & cmd3 args1.
  This will cause the program to run all of these processes in parallel, before waiting for any of them to complete.
